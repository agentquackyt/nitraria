</p>

Discover a new desert region on the edge of the new world, where explorers and pioneers can, with sweat and effort, expand the economic frontiers of your empire.

Inspired by the historical past of the Tarapacá and Atacama regions in northern Chile and the saltpeter boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this mod seeks to enrich your experience in Sandbox and Creative Mode. Considering the industrial past of this region, I have also incorporated a new production chain inspired by the saltpeter plants installed along the so-called “Pampa Calichera” in northern Chile.

</p>

The mod has been split into two complementary parts: **[Map] Nitraria Map**, which adds the new region to those already available in your game; and **[Gameplay] Nitraria - a saltpeter story**, which includes a new production chain and exclusive characters to increase your profits.

## Nitraria Map

Based on the “Seasons of Silver” scenario, three desert islands await colonization. Despite their small size and limited resources, the region offers a spectacular desert contrast within the new world. Of course, the desert environment of this new region can help you create scenarios based on the American Wild West, the arid coasts of North Africa, and many other ideas.

## Nitraria - A saltpeter story

This complementary mod incorporates a new production chain: the industrial-scale production of saltpeter and fertilizer. Based on the history of the saltpeter industry in the Tarapacá and Atacama regions, two buildings will enable exploitation: Calichera and Salitrera.

- **Calichera**
Use the available spaces in Clay Pits to install these nitrate (saltpeter) collection points.

- **Salitrera**
Take the nitrate extracted from the desert deposits, refine it by adding water at high temperature, and obtain fertilizers for your crops around the world.

- **New characters**
Use the Calichero's experience to increase the productivity of your Calichera, and the Salitrero's knowledge to increase the efficiency of your Salitrera.
Both characters are available for purchase through the New World NPC (Isabel Sarmento).

### Feature Overview
**[Map] Nitraria Map**
New map of three desert islands, based on the “Seasons of Silver” scenario. Although it starts with the buildings (and building remains) from the scenario, it is fully functional and free for construction.

**[Gameplay] Nitraria - a saltpeter story**
- Calichera: A saltpeter extraction point, built on Clay Pit. The graphic model uses the one developed in Jakob's Mod (credit for this incredible graphic goes to him).
- Salitrera: A factory capable of converting coal and saltpeter into fertilizers.
- Calichero and Salitrero characters: Two new exclusive characters to increase the efficiency of the above buildings. Available for purchase from Isabel Sarmento in the New World.

### Notes (version 1.0.1)

- The mod is compatible with Sandbox, Creative Mode & savegames. I haven't tested it in multiplayer mode.
- The only language is English. For other languages, the mod will keep the text in English.
- Alternative installation to the Platform: Go to the repository on GitHub, download both mods and install them (paste) in the game's “mods” directory. Then, load a savegame, or start a new one, including the new mods.

- Please comment or let me know about any problems in the GitHub repository. If you liked it, or have suggestions for things we could incorporate, I'd also be happy to read them.
> [!WARNING]
> This is the first version of this mod. Although i have tested it in my games (with other mods), i cannot guarantee that your savegame or new game will not crash. It is imperative that you have a backup of your games in case a crash occurs.

### Next steps:
- Translation: Expand to other languages.
- New production chains: I am considering incorporating an additional production chain based on iron and/or copper mining, but with methods and buildings that are different from those in the New World.

### Credits:
- *Jakob* beautiful graphic model for his “Sand Mine” in the New World, which I used for the Calichera building.
- *hier0nimus* incredible tutorial on developing new Mods, from which I learned a lot and which undoubtedly helped me develop this initiative.
